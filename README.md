# Gryphon-Student-Tracker

- A student tracker application that helps a university student keep track of their academic
progress by adding courses and their assignments and projects in the app along with their
deadline. A student can also set reminders and take notes in this app corresponding to a task
assignment. 
- At times, it can become difficult for a student to remember the deadlines and the
assignments or project tasks assigned in several courses. This app could help them keep track
of all the important dates at a central location and even set a reminder so that they can complete
their work in time and do not have to visit university portal every time there is a need to check
important dates, assignments, and project tasks. 
- As university students, when we take 3-4 courses in a semester/ term, it becomes difficult for us to 
remember each deadline of assignments and projects. This app can act as a portal where we can save 
every information required for us to track the work ahead of us.
- Users will add courses and add the assignments and projects assigned in corresponding
courses with their due date which will be saved in that application so that whenever user visits
the application again, he can refer to the due dates of course tasks. A reminder module will also
be added for the user to set reminders to get notified for the upcoming due dates.
